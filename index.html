                <h1>French Desert</h1>
                <p>When it comes to desserts, all hail France! France is undoubtedly the best country that offers some delicious varieties
                of exotic desserts. From classic crepes to colourful macarons, France has it all. French desserts not only taste
                scrumptious, but are also quite appealing to the eyes. Also, the word 'dessert' itself has come from the French word
                'desservir'.</p>

                <h1>Asian Pie</h1>
                <p>Pies are good in their own right, but there’s something about hand pies that are just so great. Maybe it’s because it
                somehow seems more acceptable for me to eat them at breakfast, or maybe it’s that the crust-to-filling ratio is a little
                higher on hand pies–and it’s all about the crust, right–or maybe it’s because you can eat it while you drive.</p>

                <h1>Indian Masala Curry</h1>
                <p>Curry is a variety of dishes originating in the Indian subcontinent. It uses a combination of spices or herbs, usually
                including ground turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and fresh or dried chilies. In southern India, curry leaves from
                the curry tree are also an integral ingredient.</p>

            <p>"I have found <span><strong>FOOD NETWORK</strong></span> to be extremely knowledgeable about nutrition and anything to do with health. I consult <span><strong>FOOD NETWORK</strong></span> on all
            aspects of nutrition whether it involves me or my kids. I trust her advice. Thanks to <span><strong>FOOD NETWORK</strong></span>, the owner at the preschool
            where we send our kids, has realized the importance of feeding children healthy food, and has made changes at the
            school. I can only recommend <span><strong>FOOD NETWORK</strong></span>!"</p>
